Luna.vim

A dark colourscheme for Vim created for fun

I wanted to use my `hexlt <https://raw.github.com/Pychimp/dotvim/d0a08c8f32ce5f04416840a04902ab92bd0fcb60/colors/hexlt.vim>`_ as the base, and make a few tweaks to it to make it into a dark colorscheme, but I started fresh !

This colorscheme still needs a few more tweaks, but It's still quite useable now. Take a look at the included screenshots.

Requirements
------------

This colourscheme is intended for use on:

-   gVim 7.3 for Linux, Mac and Windows.
-   Vim 7.3 for Linux, Mac and Windows.
